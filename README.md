## Hi, I’m Sofía 👋

I’m a PhD physicist working in theoretical quantum optics and photonic quantum architectures, with a strong focus on computational modeling and scientific software development.

My work sits at the intersection of quantum light–matter interactions, waveguide QED, and scalable numerical methods based on tensor networks (Matrix Product States).

---

### 🔬 What I work on

- Modeling non-Markovian open quantum systems in waveguide QED  
- Tensor-network (MPS) simulations of light–matter interactions  
- Few-photon nonlinearities, time delays, and multi-emitter systems  
- Bridging theory, numerical methods, and practical simulation tools  

I’m particularly interested in moving beyond standard master-equation approaches toward scalable, modular simulation frameworks.

  Lead developer of a Python framework for simulating one-dimensional quantum photonic architectures using tensor networks.  
  Focused on finite delays, non-Markovian dynamics, and multi-qubit systems.  
  *(Public release planned in early 2026)*

- **Quantum photonic simulation tools (Ansys INTERCONNECT)**  
  Developed Python-based tools during my industry internship at Ansys Canada, extending photonic circuit solvers to support quantum scattering and nonlinear light–matter interactions.
